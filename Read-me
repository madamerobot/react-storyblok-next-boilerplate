Your biggest three challenges throughout the project:

Understanding the connection between Storyblok and my own code.
How to properly use GitHub and make new branches.
How to make a structure when everything felt so unstructured.



Your biggest three learnings - what would you tell yourself if you started again?

To not stress so much and be so hard on myself when I don't understand and get stuck.
Next time I need to use GitHub more frequently so I really get it in my coding routine.
Have more fun with it and don't let the pressure of that it has to look amazing take over
